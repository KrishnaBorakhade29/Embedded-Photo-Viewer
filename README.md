# Mini Digital Photo Album Using Embedded System
This project is a simple and portable Mini Digital Photo Album designed using embedded systems. It features a microcontroller to control an LCD screen, where digital images are displayed. Users can navigate through images using physical buttons like "Next" and "Previous."
The project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software for managing and displaying image data, making it a great educational tool for learning embedded systems and LCD interfacing. It is a cost-effective solution suitable for hobbyists and students interested in embedded technology.
## Tech Stack
#### Hardware:

Microcontroller (e.g., 8051, PIC, or any other used in the project)
